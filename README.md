### Experiment - 5
Consider the following simplified description of a university where professors teach seminars in which students can enroll. A professor has a name, address, phone number, email address, and salary. A student has also a name, roll no.  A student, however, has an average mark (of the final marks of his or her seminars). A seminar has a name and a number. When a student is enrolled in a seminar, the marks for this enrolment are recorded and the current average as well as the final mark (if there is one) can be obtained from the enrolment. From a student one can obtain a list of seminars he or she is enrolled in. Professors teach seminars. Each seminar has at least one and at most three teachers. There are two types of seminars: bachelor and master. From a bachelor seminar students can not withdraw. From a master seminar they can. Draw a class diagram for the same.
### Experiment - 6
A book is written by an author, published by a publisher, sold by a book store, and read by a reader. Moreover, for a reader to read a book, he/she must buy it from a book store that is selling it. Draw a use case diagram for this scenario, showing relationships between different use cases.
### Experiment - 7
Draw a use case diagram to represent the following system. Over the summer holiday, university students can book college hall accommodation online. They must specify their name, student number, course, year, and identify three college residences as their preferences. The system makes an allocation of students to rooms before the start of the term, trying, where possible, to allocate students to a room in one of their preferred halls.
### Experiment - 8
Create the use case diagram according to the following elevator control system.
1. The elevator control system shall allow the passenger to call the elevator and to select the destination floor; 
2. When the passenger pushes the external button (to call the elevator), or the internal button (to select the destination floor), the central control system switches the button light on; 
3. When the passenger calls the elevator or selects the destination floor, the central control system opens/closes the elevator door; 
4. When the passenger calls the elevator or selects the destination floor, the central control system moves/stops the elevator to/at the passenger call floor or to/at the passenger destination floor. 
5. When the passenger leaves the elevator, the central control system switches the button light off.

### Experiment - 9
Draw a use case diagram for a ticket distributor for a train system.
The system includes two actors: 
- a traveler, who purchases different types of tickets
- a central computer system, which maintains a reference database for the tariff. 

Use cases should include:
- BuyOneWayTicket 
- BuyWeeklyCard
- BuyMonthlyCard
- UpdateTariff.

Also include the following exceptional cases: 
1. Time-Out (i.e., traveler took too long to insert the right amount)
2. TransactionAborted (i.e.,traveler selected the cancel button without completing the transaction)
3. DistributorOutOfChange
4. DistributorOutOfPaper.

### Experiment - 10
Draw a use case diagram for an ATM machine where Customer uses ATM to Check Balances of his/her bank accounts, Deposit Funds, Withdraw Cash and/or Transfer Funds. Customer Authentication is must for each of these ATM transactions. All these use cases also involve Bank actor whether it is related to customer transactions or to the ATM servicing. For Maintenance and Repairs functionality, ATM Technician are responsible.
### Experiment - 11
Describes the workflow for a word process to create a document through the following steps using Activity Diagram: Open the word processing package. Create a file. Save the file under a unique name within its directory. Type the document. If graphics are necessary, open the graphics package, create the graphics, and paste the graphics into the document. If a spreadsheet is necessary, open the spreadsheet package, create the spreadsheet, and paste the spreadsheet into the document. Save the file. Print a hard copy of the document. Exit the word processing package.
### Experiment - 12
A customer decides to upgrade her PC and purchase a DVD player. She begins by calling the sales department of the PC vendor and they tell her to contact customer support. She/He then calls customer support and they put her on hold while talking to engineering. Finally, customer support tells the customer about several supported DVD options. The customer chooses a DVD and it is shipped by the mail department. The customer receives the DVD, installs it satisfactorily and then mails her payment to the accounts department. Draw Activity Diagram for this Online Shopping DVD System.
